# DiscreteFourier
A small piece of Processing code that performs a DFT on your mouseclicks

Copy and paste into your Processing 3 IDE and it should run. 
Run it. You can click in the window as much as you like, when you are done just
press any key and the program will show you the Discrete Fourier Transform of all
the points you clicked.
